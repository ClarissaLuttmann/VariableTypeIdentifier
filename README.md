# VariableTypeIdentifier

I created this simple program for Java beginners who are still learning to use the different variable types correctly. 
The user is asked to enter the intended input and receives a response recommending the most suitable variable type for the input,
an explanation why this type is most appropriate and a suggested notation for initialization of the variable. 

I hope this helps someone out there getting a better hold of the varible types. Have fun! :)
